      <h1> 1st Website Ever </h1>
      
      <p> Hi, my name is Shelley! I'm learning code and how to make websites. Not only do I like code but I also like the color purple, music, art, and video games. In the future, I may make updates to this website if I don't forget but it'll be for friends and many others to chat with each other. That's it for, though! I hope whoever's reading this has a nice day! Peacesu! :p </p>
